# Art Assist

Art Assist is a Streamlit-based application that provides tools to simplify and analyze images.

[It is hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud.](https://artassist.streamlit.app/)

The application is designed to help artists better understand the values, colors, and compositions
of their reference images.

## Features

- **Image Simplification**: Reduce the number of colors in an image to better understand its value 
  structure.
- **Grid Overlay**: Overlay a customizable grid on the image to analyze composition.
- **Black-and-White Conversion**: Convert images to black-and-white to focus on value rather than
  color.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

# Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
